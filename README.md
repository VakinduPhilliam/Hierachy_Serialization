Python Hierachy Serialization.
The following scripts are written to demonstrate the process of Python object serialization (Pickling and unpickling).  
The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. 
“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.  Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.

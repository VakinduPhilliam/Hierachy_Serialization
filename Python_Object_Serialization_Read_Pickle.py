# Python object serialization
# The 'pickle' module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing 
# a Python object structure. 
# “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, 
# and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like 
# object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. 
# Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” or “flattening”; 
# however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.
# The following example reads the resulting pickled data.
 
import pickle

with open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:

    # The protocol version used is detected automatically, so we do not
    # have to specify it.

    data = pickle.load(f)

# Python object serialization
# The 'pickle' module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing 
# a Python object structure. 
# “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, 
# and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like 
# object) is converted back into an object hierarchy. 
# Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” or “flattening”; 
# however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.
# sqlite3 — DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases
# SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate 
# server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. 
# Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. 
# It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database 
# such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.
# executescript(sql_script) 
# This is a nonstandard convenience method for executing multiple SQL statements at once. 
# It issues a COMMIT statement first, then executes the SQL script it gets as a parameter.
# sql_script can be an instance of str.
